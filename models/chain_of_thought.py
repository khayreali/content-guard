                    Step 2: State what the category results are {self.category}. If the value is none, state that there is no category.

                    Step 4: Based on your thought process so far, are the classifications for the image and text, {self.img_results} and {self.txt_results}, correct? If so, state it's correct and why. If any or all are incorrect, state which ones are incorrect and skip to step 5 to explain.
                    Step 5: Skip this step if the classifications were found correct in step 4. Skip by stating "Classifications are correct, no further review required." If any or all classifications are incorrect from step 4, state why they are incorrect.
                    Step 6: Based on your thought process so far, is the categorization of the content, {self.category} from Step 2 correct? If so, state it's correct and why. If it's incorrect, state "Classification is incorrect" and skip to step 7 to explain.
